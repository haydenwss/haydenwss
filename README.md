- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hayden ðŸ¤“,
I am a Full Stack, UX/UI designer and creative developer based in Victoria, British Columbia. 
I am a self taught developer, as well as attending Coding Dojo in 2019 - one of the top coding bootcamps in the US, with campuses all over the country.

I think understanding the human experience is essential for creating useful and effective products that make life easier. 
I enjoy using my skill-set to empower people to accomplish their goals. My development stack is focused on performance & accessibility with delightful interactions and transitional effects.
